# SurvivalBot
SurvivalBot is a custom minecraft bot that is specifically designed to connect to survival.munchymc.com. While the bot is on the server, it reads the chat and keeps track of all on going auctions. Every completed auction gets entered into a remote database. Players that are also on the server can request the average sales price of any item by typing  `[Bot IGN] price [Item name]`. 

Note that botted accounts are no longer allowed on survival.munchymc.com, so this code should not be used anymore. The reason this project has been made public is because many people were interested in how this project was coded.
